## Overview
Welcome to the Lesotho Climate Project! This guide will help you access project materials and contribute to the development of the project locally.

The purpose of this project is to create an RShiny dashbaord to help the government of Lesotho make more informed climate decisions.

## Accessing Climate Project Materials on GitHub
All project materials, including codes and documentation, are available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ey2367/Climate_Project).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into four main folders, each serving a specific purpose:
1. **Dashboard:** Contains files related to the main RShiny dashboard application.
2. **Gantt Chart:** Includes materials related to the project's Gantt chart and project timeline.
    <Gantt Chart/gantt.R>: This Gantt Chart provides a visual representation of the TIMELINE and FORCAST, aiding decision-makers in understanding Lesotho's drought conditions.
    - To use this chart, you'll need to download the 'all1.xlsx' and 'left.xlsx' files
3. **Graphs:** This folder holds code and documentation for generating various graphs related to climate data.
    <Graphs/Line Graph (Rain Forecast & History).R>: the graph showing past and forecasted rainfall in Lesotho. 
    -  To run the code, you need to download the 'lesotho_pop_short1.csv' file
    <Graphs/Population by district (Bar).R> : the graph illustrating the population distribution across districts in Lesotho
4. **Map:** Contains files related to the map visualization component of the project.
